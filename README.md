## **Explaining the project**

My project is a simple Weather App. This weather app is built using JavaScript and the Weather by API Ninjas API provided by RapidAPI to fetch live weather data for a given location. The app displays the current temperature and weather condition. It also allows users to search for the weather in different locations.

The main features of the weather app include displaying the current temperature and a weather condition for a searched location. Users can enter the name of a location in the search bar, and the app will fetch live weather data for that location from the Weather by API Ninjas API.

The weather data is presented in a user-friendly format that is easy to read and understand. The app provides real-time weather updates, allowing users to stay up-to-date with the latest weather conditions for a particular location.

Overall, this weather app is a simple, yet powerful tool that provides users with access to live weather data for any location in the world.

# **Features**

- Displays current temperature, weather condition, and a weather icon for the searched location.
- Allows users to search for the weather in different locations.
- Uses JavaScript to fetch live weather data from an external API.
- Uses HTML and CSS to create a user-friendly interface.

## **About CS50**

An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming.

Thank you for all CS50.
